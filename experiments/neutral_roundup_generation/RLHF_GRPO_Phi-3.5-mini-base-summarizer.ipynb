The striking reversal came hours after a violent mob of the president's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, and followed weeks of Trump and his allies fighting the election results. \\\"Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th,\\\" Trump said, according to a statement attributed to him and released by the White House. Trump was unable to release the statement himself after Twitter temporarily locked his accounts for \\\"repeated and severe violations\\\" of the company's civic integrity policy. District of Columbia National Guard stand outside the Capitol on Wednesday night after a day of rioting protesters. John Minchillo / AP Trump has repeatedly and baselessly claimed that the election was stolen or that there was widespread fraud, for which there has been no evidence. Not long before the mob descended on the Capitol, Trump told protesters at a rally near the White House that \\\"we're going to have to fight much harder.\\\" Even after the assault on the Capitol, Trump continued to push conspiracy theories about the election on social media. In a video posted to Twitter, he repeated unfounded claims that the election was taken from him and encouraged his supporters to disperse. He said that law and order were needed and that he loved his supporters. He also repeatedly urged Vice President Mike Pence, who presided over the vote count in Congress, to throw out states' votes or somehow send them back to the states, which he does not have the power to do. After the assault on the Capitol, Trump faced mounting pressure from previous backers to accept that Biden had won. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump ally, said after the riot that Biden was lawfully elected and that it was time to accept it. \\\"Count me out. Enough is enough,\\\" he said. \\\"We've got to end it.\\\" Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also called the riot a \\u201cfailed insurrection\\u201d and underscored lawmakers\\u2019 duty to confirm the vote. He stopped short however, of acknowledging that Trump and his own party had incited the riots. In addition, a growing number of White House officials submitted their resignations on Wednesday, including Melania Trump's chief of staff, and deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews. Other more senior members of the Trump administration were also considering putting in their letters of resignation, including national security adviser Robert O'Brien, deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, according to people familiar with the matter. Some Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, called for the president\\u2019s impeachment. Biden on Wednesday emotionally condemned the violence saying that it \\\"borders on sedition\\\" and implored Trump to go on national television to \\\"demand an end to this siege.\\\" \\\"The words of a president matter, no matter how good or bad that president,\\\" Biden said. \\\"At their best, the words of a president can inspire. At their worst, they can incite.\\\"\",\n          \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\\u2019s executive editor is stepping down after his newspaper ran a headline reading \\u201cBuildings Matter, Too\\u201d that garnered widespread backlash. June 12 will be the last day for the newspaper\\u2019s top editor, Stan Wischnowski, CNN reported, citing a memo shared with the Inquirer\\u2019s staff. His replacement has not been announced. Dozens of journalists for the newspaper called out of work last Thursday, two days after the headline ran in print amid public demonstrations and social unrest following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in police custody in Minneapolis. The headline \\u2014 referencing Black Lives Matter \\u2014 in Tuesday\\u2019s paper accompanied a column denouncing the destruction of buildings in Philadelphia amid the unrest. The newspaper apologized on Wednesday for running a headline that \\u201csuggested an equivalence between the loss of buildings and the lives of black Americans.\\u201d An open letter signed by 44 journalists for the Inquirer said the staff is tired of \\u201cworking for months and years to gain the trust of our communities \\u2014 communities that have long had good reason to not trust our profession \\u2014 only to see that trust eroded in an instant by careless, unempathetic decisions.\\u201d Wischnowski, who\\u2019s also the Inquirer\\u2019s senior vice president, joined the newspaper more than 20 years ago and has been in the executive editor position for 10. The memo announcing his exit was sent to staff by the newspaper\\u2019s publisher, Lisa Hughes. Floyd, who was 46, died on May 25. A criminal complaint accuses fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin of kneeling on Floyd\\u2019s neck for more than eight minutes. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, while three other officers have also been fired and were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder in connection with Floyd\\u2019s death.\",\n          \"Christopher Wray has just been confirmed as the next FBI director in a 92-5 Senate vote, replacing James Comey and thrusting himself squarely in the middle of the investigation into the Trump campaign\\u2019s possible collusion with Russia during the 2016 election. But getting a bitterly divided Senate to confirm him was an easy challenge compared with what comes next. Wray will have to convince government officials \\u2014 especially FBI employees \\u2014 and the general public that he will be an independent-minded leader and not a Trump lackey. He addressed this very issue during his confirmation hearing. \\u201cI think the relationship between any FBI director and any president needs to be a professional one, not a social one,\\u201d Wray said. Still, he will face skepticism when he walks into FBI headquarters on his first day. As my Vox colleague Dara Lind explains: Wray is a former Justice Department official. He ran the criminal division of the Department of Justice under George W. Bush, from 2003 to 2005. That means he has professional experience working with the FBI, though not experience working within it. FBI agents might see that as a crucial difference. They value their independence, which they feel is under attack from the White House. And they have reason not to trust that the Trump administration (and Trump family) is doing everything it can to help with the investigation. So Wray has his work cut out for him: not only proving himself to his new colleagues, but also overseeing the Russia investigation, which reaches all the way to the White House\\u2019s power center. Yesterday, for example, the Washington Post reported that Trump dictated his son Donald Trump Jr.\\u2019s misleading response about the meeting he and other campaign officials had with a Kremlin-tied lawyer during the election. It remains to be seen if Wray will be able to do the job \\u2014 and for how long an anxious president will allow him to do it. One thing is for sure: Wray won\\u2019t want to meet the same fate Comey did. Wray seems to disagree with Trump on a lot One noteworthy thing about Wray is that he appears to disagree with many of the president\\u2019s views. First \\u2014 and most critically \\u2014 he doesn\\u2019t believe special counsel Robert Mueller is on a witch hunt as he leads the Russia probe. \\u201cI do not consider Director Mueller to be on a witch hunt,\\u201d he told Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). Wray also believes Russia acted in an adversarial manner toward the United States when it tried to influence the 2016 election. And he believes he and the president should not meet one on one unless there is an important national security matter to discuss. Finally, he\\u2019s not of the opinion that Comey is a \\u201cnut job,\\u201d as Trump described him back in May. Throughout his hearing, Wray made a point to show that he is not Trump\\u2019s guy \\u2014 just his pick. He even noted he would leave his post if he felt he were being asked to do something unethical by the president. \\u201cI would try to talk him out of it,\\u201d Wray said, if that kind of inquiry came in to him. \\u201cAnd if that failed, I would resign.\\u201d But for now, Wray has the job. Many will be interested to see what he does with it \\u2014 especially the president.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"right_article\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 429,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Congress early Thursday morning certified President-elect Joe Biden\\u2019s election victory after two Republican-led challenges to swing state electors were shot down.

Before confirming Biden\\u2019s win, objections to his victories in Arizona and Pennsylvania were brought up \\u2014 and subsequently squashed \\u2014 during the joint-session of Congress. Other planned objections were dropped by several Republican Senators after Wednesday\\u2019s unrest.

Wray succeeds James Comey, who was fired by President Donald Trump. Wray, a graduate from Yale University, was a top Justice Department official during the George W. Bush administration. He was recommended unanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 20. During his confirmation hearings, the private attorney said he would not be \\\"pulling punches\\\" in the position and that he'd resign if he is asked to do something illegal or immoral, even by the White House. \\\"My commitment is to the rule of law, to the Constitution, to follow the facts wherever they may lead,\\\" Wray told the judiciary panel. \\\"And there isn't a person on this planet whose lobbying or influence could convince me to just drop or abandon a properly predicated and meritorious investigation.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"center_article\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 429,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Congress certified President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris' victory early on Thursday, the end of a long day and night marked by chaos and violence in Washington, D.C. Extremists emboldened by President Trump had sought to thwart the peaceful transfer of power that has been a hallmark of modern American history by staging a violent insurrection inside the U.S. Capitol. \\\"To those who wreaked havoc in our Capitol today, you did not win,\\\" Vice President Pence said once lawmakers reconvened after many spent hours in lockdown. \\\"Violence never wins. Freedom wins, and this is still the people's house.\\\" Biden and Harris finished with 306 electoral votes, while Trump and Pence had 232. It takes 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. In a statement released just after the certification was finalized, Trump at long last acknowledged his election loss. He said that even though he disagrees with the outcome, \\\"there will be an orderly transition on January 20th.\\\" \\\"I have always said we would continue our ... fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted. While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!\\\" Dozens of Republican House lawmakers, along with some Republican senators supportive of Trump, had planned to object Wednesday to the electoral votes of as many as six states that backed Biden. But late Wednesday night, some Senate Republicans withdrew their objections. Each objection requires the backing of a member of both the House and the Senate to be considered. Sens. Steve Daines of Montana, Mike Braun of Indiana and Kelly Loeffler of Georgia all said that they would stand down. \\\"I cannot now, in good conscience, object to the certification of these electors,\\\" Loeffler said Wednesday, drawing applause from some of her colleagues. Loeffler was one of two Republicans who lost their races on Tuesday, giving Democrats control of the U.S. Senate. Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who took up Trump's call that lawmakers object to the results of the election, said Wednesday night that the Senate should consider his objections, but that they should be debated \\\"without violence, without attacks, without bullets.\\\" Senate lawmakers voted late Wednesday to reject the challenge to Biden's victory in the state of Arizona, and the House followed suit, but with many Republicans in favor of overturning the state's results. A similar result played out for the state of Pennsylvania, with both chambers voting to reject the challenge to Biden's victory there. Republican House lawmakers also objected to the electoral votes in Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, but no senator would join in those objections. \\\"In that case, the objection cannot be entertained,\\\" Pence said repeatedly, chairing the proceedings in his role as president of the Senate. So the count continued, state by state, with Vermont's three electoral votes putting Biden and Harris over the 270 mark, until finally Wyoming's three electoral votes were tallied for Trump and Pence. How the chaos unfolded The process to affirm Biden's victory began in the early afternoon. The typically ceremonial affair, an affirmation of the democratic process, was expected to be a bitter, hours-long endeavor because of objections planned by Trump's congressional allies, despite the fact that they were certain to be met with bipartisan defeat. But as the process began, a mob of pro-Trump extremists stormed the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon, bringing the counting of the electoral votes to a halt. Lawmakers were evacuated from the building as the violent, chaotic scene played out, prompting a citywide curfew. One woman was killed by a Capitol Police officer in the Capitol. Wednesday night, D.C. police said three other people died from medical emergencies in the surrounding area. Around 8 p.m. ET, hours after the Capitol was breached, lawmakers were cleared to return to finish debate and tally the Electoral College votes. In separate speeches in their respective chambers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed to press ahead with the business at hand. \\\"We will not bow to lawlessness or intimidation. We are back at our posts,\\\" McConnell said, adding, \\\"and we're going to do it tonight.\\\" Trump's pressure The scene that unfolded at the Capitol on Wednesday was the culmination of months of efforts by Trump and his allies, publicly and privately, to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Some of those efforts were based on unproven claims of fraudulent vote counts, while others were founded on baseless conspiracy theories. Trump had been particularly focused on Pence's role, publicly ratcheting up pressure on his vice president in recent days \\u2014 including as he addressed supporters on Wednesday \\u2014 to back his efforts to reverse the 2020 election results. Pence, though, said Wednesday that he did not have the power to change the outcome of the election or to unilaterally delay the certification of Biden's victory. And the insurrectionists that disrupted the certification of the Electoral College votes did so after Trump spoke to them, demanding that they fight to \\\"stop the steal\\\" of the election \\u2014 a false claim \\u2014 and descend on the Capitol. \\\"After this, we're going to walk down \\u2014 and I'll be there with you \\u2014 we're going to walk down, we're going to walk down to the Capitol,\\\" Trump said earlier Wednesday, \\\"and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.\\\" As the mob drew down on the Capitol, Trump remained largely silent and did not make widespread remarks condemning the violence, or attempts to quell it. At one point, he tweeted a short video in which he repeated claims \\u2014 without evidence \\u2014 regarding voter fraud and a stolen election, while saying \\\"we love you\\\" to the mob that had descended on Washington and urging them to go home. Later Wednesday, he tweeted that \\\"these are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long.\\\" Twitter later demanded that the tweet and video be removed, and the platform temporarily locked the president's account, threatening to permanently suspend it. Condemnation of the president For his part, Biden called on the president to direct his supporters to end what he described as an \\\"unprecedented assault\\\" on democracy that \\\"borders on sedition.\\\" \\\"I call on President Trump to go on national television now to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege,\\\" Biden said in brief remarks. The president-elect also suggested that Trump was to blame for the violence, saying that \\\"at the best, the words of a president can inspire. At their worst, they can incite.\\\" As the chaos unfolded, some House Democrats have called for impeaching the president again during his final two weeks in office. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota wrote on Twitter that she was drawing up articles of impeachment. \\\"We can't allow him to remain in office, it's a matter of preserving our republic,\\\" she wrote. Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline faulted the president for the violence that consumed the Capitol and said, \\\"We should impeach and convict him tomorrow.\\\" Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark, D-Mass. called the president \\\"a traitor to our country and our Constitution\\\" and called for him to be removed from office \\\"and prevented from further endangering our country and our people.\\\" Trump also faced critics within his own party for his role in egging on the mob. \\\"What happened today was nothing short of a coup attempt. The President of the United States has been lying to his supporters with false information and false expectations,\\\" Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick said in a tweet. \\\"He lit the flame of incitement and owns responsibility for this.\\\" And Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said that it's \\\"past time\\\" for Trump to \\\"accept his defeat, quit misleading the people, and repudiate mob violence.\\\"\",\n          \"PHILADELPHIA (AP) \\u2014 The Philadelphia Inquirer\\u2019s top editor is resigning after an uproar over a headline lamenting damage to businesses amid turbulent protests denouncing police brutality against people of color, the paper announced Saturday. The newspaper said Stan Wischnowski, 58, was stepping down as senior vice president and executive editor. The Inquirer had apologized for a \\u201chorribly wrong\\u201d decision to use the headline, \\u201cBuildings Matter, Too,\\u201d on a column Tuesday about looting and vandalism on the margins of protests of George Floyd\\u2019s death in Minneapolis at the hands of a white police officer. The backlash came as The New York Times was widely criticized for publishing an opinion piece by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton advocating the use of federal troops to quell the protests. About 30 members of the Inquirer\\u2019s 210-member editorial staff called in sick earlier this week, and black staff members angrily condemned the headline. It appeared over an article by architecture critic Inga Saffron, who worried that buildings damaged in violence over the past week could \\u201cleave a gaping hole in the heart of Philadelphia.\\u201d The Inquirer drew fresh scorn after it replaced that headline online with one that read, \\u201cBlack Lives Matter. Do Buildings?\\u201d Eventually, the newspaper settled on \\u201cDamaging buildings disproportionately hurt the people protesters are trying to uplift.\\u201d The Inquirer published an apology from senior editors. Publisher and CEO Lisa Hughes said in a memo to staff that the headline was \\u201coffensive and inappropriate\\u201d and said the newspaper needed a more diverse workforce. Wischnowski had worked at the Inquirer for 20 years and was editor when the paper won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for an in-depth investigation into violence within Philadelphia schools. He will formally leave the newspaper June 12. Hughes did not immediately name a successor.\",\n          \"WASHINGTON \\u2014 The Senate voted Tuesday to confirm Christopher Wray as FBI director, nearly three months after President Trump fired former director James Comey as the FBI was investigating possible collusion between Trump's presidential campaign and Russian officials. Senators voted 92-5 to confirm Wray, a former assistant attorney general who served under Comey, to a 10-year term. Democratic Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Ron Wyden of Oregon voted \\\"no.\\\" Unlike most of Trump's nominees, Wray has proved to be an uncontroversial choice. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 20-0 last month to recommend that Wray be confirmed by the full Senate. Wray will lead the FBI at a particularly turbulent time in its history, and he promised senators during his confirmation hearing that he will remain independent in the face of any political pressure from the White House. Trump fired Comey on May 9, raising the specter of political influence in a criminal investigation. \\\"This is a tough time to take this tough job,\\\" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who serves on the Judiciary Committee. \\\"Mr. Wray showed that he has the integrity, that he will follow the law, and that he believes in the independence of the FBI ... Most importantly for me, he showed the respect for the agents, he showed a respect for his predecessors \\u2014 both Mr. (Robert) Mueller and Mr. Comey \\u2014 he showed a respect for the law, and he understood the somber time in which he comes in to take this job.\\\" Mueller, who was FBI director from 2001 to 2013, is now serving as special counsel for the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election in 2016 and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the probe because of his own contacts with Russian officials while serving as an adviser to the Trump campaign. The president has repeatedly expressed anger at Sessions for recusing himself and said in an interview last month with The New York Times that he would not have chosen Sessions if he'd known that the former Alabama senator would step away from the investigation. Senate panel votes to confirm Christopher Wray as new FBI director Trump's FBI director nominee Chris Wray: 'No one asked me for any kind of loyalty oath' Who is Christopher Wray, Donald Trump's FBI pick? Senators of both parties said they were impressed that Wray testified that he did not consider Mueller's investigation to be \\\"a witch hunt,\\\" as Trump has described it. Wray also vowed that he would resign rather than comply with any order from the White House to drop an investigation. \\\"Many members asked Mr. Wray very pointed questions about loyalty during his hearing,\\\" said Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. \\\"I was impressed with his plain-spoken, candid answers. And I take him at his word when he says that his 'loyalty is to the Constitution and the rule of law' and when he says that he will 'never allow the FBI's work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice.' \\\" Wray \\\"is a professional, as non-politically affiliated as anyone can be going into the job,\\\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. He said Wray's most important job \\\"will be to protect the special counsel investigation.\\\" Wray graduated from Yale Law School in 1992. He served as assistant U.S. attorney for the northern district of Georgia from 1997 through 2001 before joining the Justice Department, where he led the criminal division as assistant attorney general. He worked under Comey, who was then serving as deputy attorney general. Wray left the Justice Department in 2005 to join the law firm of King & Spalding, where he represented big companies in state and federal investigations. He also served as personal attorney to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the 2013 Bridgegate scandal. Larry Thompson, former deputy attorney general during the George W. Bush administration, said \\\"Trump couldn't have picked a better man\\\" than Wray. \\\"He played a key role on the Corporate Fraud Task Force, coordinating the DOJ\\u2019s actions in response to corporate accounting scandals,\\\" Thompson wrote in an op-ed in the Independent Journal Review. \\\"He famously oversaw the federal investigation of Enron, which resulted in multiple prosecutions and sent a clear message that corporate executives will be held accountable for their actions.\\\" \\\"He also worked closely with other top Department of Justice officials to restructure the Department in the wake of 9/11 to better confront and prevent terrorism,\\\" Thompson wrote. \\\"He played a direct role in the prosecution of al Qaida operative Zacarias Moussaoui and the Washington, D.C. snipers.\\\" Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said she was encouraged by Wray's opposition to waterboarding and other forms of torture during the interrogation of suspected terrorists. The committee, when Feinstein was chairman in 2014, issued a report detailing torture techniques used by the CIA in the wake of 9/11. The report concluded that the torture was both brutal and ineffective. \\\"Importantly for me, he (Wray) has committed that the FBI, under his leadership, will never engage in such techniques or other forms of torture,\\\" Feinstein said. \\\"I take Mr. Wray at his word.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"roundup\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 430,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Congress certified President-elect Joe Biden's victory shortly before 4:00 a.m. ET Thursday.

The conclusions followed chaos in Washington D.C. Wednesday, as Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol building and forced an abrupt adjournment of the vote count. One woman was reportedly killed by gunfire from Capitol police during the mayhem. Coverage of the confirmation from left-rated sources often emphasized Wednesday's violence in the context of Trump's voter fraud claims and rallying of his supporters.

Headline\n","December 2017 Jobs Report\n","### Left Article\n","The U.S. economy added 148,000 jobs in December after a year of steady hiring, missing expectations for a larger last-minute surge, the government reported Friday. The unemployment rate stayed at 4.1 percent last month, the lowest point since 2000. Wages continued their slow climb, rising by 9 cents to $26.63. That’s a 2.5 percent increase since December 2016 (and still below pre-recession levels). President Trump's first year in the White House brought healthy growth and 2.1 million new jobs, a slight drop from 2.2 million positions created during Obama's last year in office, government estimates showed Friday. The average number of jobs employers added each month in 2017 was 173,000, compared to the previous year’s 187,000. One dark spot was retail, which lost 20,000 jobs in December, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. About 67,000 positions vanished from stores in 2017, a sharp reversal from the 203,000 jobs that were added in 2016. “That’s a notoriously volatile number around the holiday season, but it also reflects in part that increasing number of sales are coming from e-commerce and not brick and mortar stores,” said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide. “That’s part of a longer term decline in that sector.” Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said in a statement Friday that the December report reflected “steady growth.” “With President Trump signing tax reform into law, 2018 will continue last year’s successes and, we hope, bring needed increases in wages and labor force participation,” he said. “Job creation, wage growth, and retirement savings drive prosperity and financial security. Strong growth in all is necessary.” Manufacturing saw strong gains in December, adding 25,000 jobs. The industry generated 196,000 jobs last year, compared to a loss of 16,000 positions in 2016. Analysts had predicted between 200,000 and 250,000 new positions would be created in December. “It’s certainly disappointing, but we’re still topping off a strong year for job creation, said Mike Loewengart, vice of president of investment strategy at E*TRADE, a financial services company in New York. The BLS report still sends a promising message to job seekers: Employers will be increasingly desperate for your applications in 2018. And while wages stayed flat in 2017, the unemployment rate sank at a faster pace, which gives economists hope that raises are on the horizon. “There’s almost one job open for every unemployed person,” said Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America, a credit insurance firm. There are now six million vacancies in the United States and 6.6 million unemployed people, to be more precise. However, companies nationwide keep struggling to fill roles, citing tight labor markets, retiring baby boomers and failed drug tests. Factories, hospitals, contractors and eateries, among other employers, face this trouble. “Restaurants are finding it extremely challenging to find workers,” Sonia Riggs, president and chief executive of the Colorado Restaurant Association, said in an email. “Many have even eliminated drug testing because finding employees is so difficult.” Employers increasingly are turning to on-the-job training to find and retain employees — but that could be keeping wages down. “In manufacturing and metals, especially, employers have been saying to me, ‘I could grow faster if I could find somebody, anybody,' ” said North, the economist. “They’ll hire whoever they can find, pay them a low wage and train them up.” Roughly 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 each day, and not enough young workers are cycling in to replace them. One forecast from Goldman Sachs predicted the unemployment rate will dip to 3.5 percent by the end of next year, the lowest since 1969. \"Such a scenario would take the U.S. labor market into territory almost never seen outside of a major wartime mobilization,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote in November. Economists can’t agree on why wages haven’t lifted with the demand for workers. As paid training spreads and more workers master skills that boost their productivity, paychecks should grow too, as companies compete for workers, said Josh Wright, chief economist at iCIMS, a hiring software company. “We’ll see more turnover,” he said. “Employers will be poaching more workers, and if workers feel undervalued, thinking, ‘I should have gotten that raise,’ they’re going to make a move.” That could be especially true in health care, which drove much of the job growth in 2017 and doesn’t appear to be slowing down. Nurses, physician assistants, home health aides and physical therapists are among the country’s fastest-growing jobs as the population ages. While manufacturing has enjoyed a four-month growth streak, analysts expect the sector to remain a sliver of the economy, compared to service-based work. But the hiring blitz hasn’t touched every corner of the country. West Virginia, where mining jobs have faded in recent decades, still has one of the highest jobless rates in the country (5.3 percent), and Ohio, which was hit hard by the manufacturing downturn, continues to grapple with a higher-than-average share of unemployed people (4.8 percent). “We can’t just say everything is roses,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union. People in areas where opportunities have declined are showing less desire to pack up and leave. In 2017, only 11.2 percent of Americans relocated, the smallest share since the Census began tracking it in 1948. Of those who moved, fewer than a fifth said they left for an employment-related reason.\n","### Center Article\n","The labor market slowed in December as U.S. employers added 148,000 jobs in a sign that worker shortages may crimp hiring in 2018. The unemployment rate, which is calculated from a different survey, was unchanged at 4.1%, the Labor Department said Friday. Maximize your savings: Best high-yield savings accounts The report provides the first unvarnished glimpse of hiring in several months. Average job growth topped 200,000 in October and November but economists attributed much of the increase to a bounce-back after hurricanes in Texas and Florida kept workers at home and suppressed September payrolls. The unemployment rate, a 17-year low, has spawned a tight market that may continue to scale back employment growth. \"The challenge in 2018 will be how to continue to add jobs when there are fewer people looking for them,\" says James Marple, senior economist for TD Economics. Last month, average hourly wages rose 9 cents to $26.63, nudging the annual increase to 2.5% from 2.4%. Pay gains have been stuck at about 2.5% for well over a year. Economists have expected a bigger spike because of the low unemployment rate that’s making it tougher for employers to find workers. Businesses added 146,000 jobs. Federal, state and local governments added 2,000. Job gains for October and November were revised down by a total 9,000. October’s was revised to 211,000 from 244,000 and November’s was upgraded to 252,000 from 228,000. A broader unemployment measure that includes discouraged workers and part-timers who prefer full-time jobs, as well as the unemployed, ticked up to 8.1% from 8% but is down from 9.1% a year ago. At least part of December’s weak performance can be chalked up to 20,000 job losses in retail, which faces upheaval as Americans increasingly shop online. Yet even professional and business services added just 19,000 jobs, far below its typical pace. Healthcare and leisure and hospitality each added 29,000. Mid-December storms played a role in tempering employment, Goldman Sachs said in a research note. Construction, however, added a relatively robust 30,000 jobs as rebuilding accelerated in the hurricane zones in Texas and Florida. Manufacturing added 25,000 as U.S. factories continue to benefit from an improving global economy and a revival in oil drilling. The disappointing report probably won’t stop the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates as soon as March in an effort to head off eventual jump in inflation as low unemployment pushes wages higher, several economists said. “We do not think that today’s employment report will keep the Federal Reserve from (hiking rates again in March) given other strong recent economic data…and the pickup in wage gains,” says David Berson, Nationwide’s chief economist. The Fed tentatively plans three quarter-point rate hikes this year. For 2017, monthly job gains averaged 171,000, down from 187,000 in 2016 and 226,000 in 2015. Many economists expect average increases of about 160,000 this year as the low unemployment rate offers employers a smaller pool of available workers. Yet even that more moderate pace would be far more than enough to continue pushing down the jobless rate. And the smaller stock of job candidates should ignite faster wage gains as businesses compete more intensely for applicants. Other economists, however, point to a shadow supply of workers who aren’t counted in the official unemployment rate, such as discouraged Americans who stopped looking for jobs but may be lured back into an improving market. That group could keep hiring elevated and temper pay increases well into 2018. Other recent labor market indicators have been encouraging. Payroll processor ADP this week said businesses added 250,000 jobs in December. And surveys of the manufacturing and service sectors continue to show sharp pickups in activity. Many economists believe the economy grew at close to a 3% annual pace during the last three months of the year. That would mark the third straight quarter of advances at or above the sturdy 3% level.\n","### Right Article\n","Nearly 150,000 jobs were added last month while the unemployment rate remained steady from November, according to the Department of Labor’s December jobs report. Americans’ average hourly income rose by 9 cents to $26.63 in the last month of the year, securing a 2.5 percent increase in wages over 2017, The New York Times reports. At 148,000 jobs, the number came in lower than predicted. With six million open jobs in the U.S. and 6.6 million people currently unemployed, hiring should remain strong throughout 2018, however, according to The Washington Post. In total, 2017’s average monthly job growth was below the previous year, yet still at healthy levels, economists say. Throughout the year, employers found skilled labor harder to find and keep. Retiring baby boomer and drug abuse has resulted in many open positions, while competitive labor markets make hiring difficult, WaPo reports. Companies in the most competitive markets have begun increasing wages in order to attract the workers they need.

He did not specify who \"they\" are. \"Speaking loudly and clearly for the Trump Administration, we won’t let that happen,\" he said. The president did not elaborate on how the government might intervene. His Saturday morning tweets follow a week in which Apple, Facebook, Spotify and YouTube have removed shows and video posted by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Twitter suspended Jones from its platform for a week. Jones most famously promoted the idea that the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting never happened and was staged. While Trump did not single out Jones, he appeared on Jones' InfoWars show in 2015 and praised him, saying, \"Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.\" In July, Twitter announced it is cracking down on \"incivility and intolerance\" in Twitter conversations, but has not singled out any particular political viewpoint. Among recent cases: •Ahead of a United the Right 2 rally last week in Washington, D.C., Twitter suspended the accounts associated with Proud Boys, a right-wing group present at a 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and its founder, Gavin McInnes. A Twitter spokesperson said the accounts had been suspended from Twitter and Periscope for violating company policy \"prohibiting violent extremist groups.\" •In January, former Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., a strong Trump supporter known for his incendiary rhetoric, was briefly banned from Twitter. •In February,Twitter banned Paul Nehlen, a Republican challenging House Speaker Paul Ryan for a congressional seat, for a racist tweet targeting American actress Meghan Markle, the then-fiancée of Prince Harry, NPR reported. While warning social media against any crackdown, Trump said he was not suggesting putting clamps on liberal views. \"Censorship is a very dangerous thing & absolutely impossible to police.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2018 Earlier in August, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was removed from various social media platforms such as Facebook and Youtube. Many critics warned that despite Jones espousing arguably fringe views and outright lies, the censorship of non-leftist thinkers would continue and target conservative thinkers and remove conservatives from various platforms. CRTV's Gavin McInnes was recently kicked off Twitter for reasons unknown, other than that he supposedly violated their guidelines. But, conservatives have long argued that even if these social media websites do not explicitly block an individual or organization from using their platform, that the company would in effect place a \"shadow ban\" on their accounts and prevent their followers from seeing their tweets. James O'Keefe's Project Veritas even recorded Twitter engineers discussing how they planned on preventing certain viewpoints from being aired on their platform. \"Yeah. That’s something we’re working on. It’s something we’re working on. We’re trying to get the sh*tty people to not show up,\" one engineer said on a recorded video. \"It’s a product thing we’re working on right now.” As further evidence showed, \"sh*tty\" in this case would mean anybody who was tweeting about guns, God, or the flag or other right-leaning viewpoints. Not only does Twitter shadow ban prominent Republicans, they also consider any Trump supporter who tweets about \"God,\" \"guns,\" or \"the flag\" a Russian bot (as seen in our undercover expose.) https://t.co/lxo0JoN2GP pic.twitter.com/MAPhk8tsvr — James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) July 25, 2018 While that video purports to show what happens behind the scenes at just Twitter, many on the right fear that this sort of shadowbanning occurs on all left-wing platforms that spring out of the liberal Silicon Valley. Just last night, Dennis Prager's \"Prager U\" showed statistics highlighting that despite having nearly 3 million followers on Facebook, their most recent 9 posts were seen by zero of their followers.

The president's tweets appear to indicate that he wants to address the issue but given that conservatives often argue against market interference the exact remedy to the solution remains unclear.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(test_dataset['prompt'][19], tokenize = False, add_generation_prompt = True)\n","\n","from vllm import SamplingParams\n","sampling_params = SamplingParams(\n","    temperature = 0.8,\n","    top_p = 0.95,\n","    max_tokens = 1024,\n",")\n","output = model.fast_generate(\n","    text,\n","    sampling_params = sampling_params,\n","    lora_request = model.load_lora(\"grpo_saved_lora\"),\n",")[0].outputs[0].text\n","\n","output"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":157},"id":"7VK6um8kdTrj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743759274844,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2798,"user":{"displayName":"Jahnavi Murali","userId":"10301287346042700169"}},"outputId":"1840127a-051b-4b72-f299-102cb4e253d2"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Processed prompts: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:02<00:00,  2.80s/it, est. speed input: 887.80 toks/s, output: 67.55 toks/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["' President Donald Trump criticized social media companies for allegedly discriminating against conservative voices, claiming they are \"totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices\" and accused them of \"closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT.\" He warned against censorship, which he considers \"a very dangerous thing & absolutely impossible to police,\" while acknowledging that he himself sometimes consumes content from what he views as \"fake\" media outlets like CNN and MSNBC.

The decision on Tuesday to release the suspect and the Islamic State’s claim of responsibility for the bloody attack inflicted a damaging blow to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government. On a chaotic day of grief and uncertainty, after 12 people were killed and dozens injured on Monday, leaders of the country’s rising far-right Alternative for Germany party assailed the chancellor in blunt, visceral terms, describing the victims as “Merkel’s dead.” The attack, which saw a driver steer a speeding tractor-trailer through crowds of shoppers at a popular Christmas market in central Berlin, is already reshaping what promises to be a tumultuous European political year in 2017. Ms. Merkel is the most powerful defender of the reeling European Union, yet such a bloody terror attack on German soil is certain to complicate her campaign for a fourth term in office. The prospect that she could be weakened, or voted out, would be potentially devastating for the bloc.\n","### Center Article\n","The German authorities say they cannot be sure if a man in custody was behind Monday's lorry attack on a Berlin Christmas market that killed 12 people. \"We have to entertain the theory that the detainee might possibly not have been the perpetrator,\" federal prosecutor Peter Frank told reporters. The style of attack and the target suggested Islamic extremism, he said. A vigil has been held at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, right next to the scene of the attack. The man detained, who has denied involvement, arrived in Germany from Pakistan at the end of last year. He was captured in a park after reportedly fleeing the scene. Before attending the vigil, German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed to punish those responsible for the attack \"as harshly as the law requires\".\n","### Right Article\n","The manhunt for the perpetrator of an Islamic State-claimed attack on a Christmas market in Berlin continued Tuesday as German police said \"we may still have a dangerous criminal out there.\" Peter Frank, the country’s top prosecutor, said investigators are treating Monday's attack on the market outside Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church as an act of terrorism. At least 12 people were killed and more than 50 were injured after a truck plowed through a crowd at the market. ISIS -- through its media arm on Tuesday -- claimed responsibility for the massacre and called the attacker \"a soldier of the Islamic State,\" a typical phrase used by the group when an assailant has been inspired but not directed. A man who was previously in custody -- identified as a Pakistani citizen who came to Germany last year, had been picked up based on a description of a man who jumped out of the truck and fled after the attack. But federal prosecutors said late Tuesday that he denied any involvement and they had found no forensic evidence proving he was in the cab during the rampage. Additionally, no witnesses had followed him from the scene to the spot where he was picked up. Police sources told the country's Die Welt newspaper that they had the “wrong man” and that the true perpetrator “is still armed, at large and can cause fresh damage.” \"We may still have a dangerous criminal out there,\" Berlin police chief Klaus Kandt said. Holger Muench, head of Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office, said they have not yet found a pistol believed to be used to kill the truck’s passenger, who was identified by police as 37-year-old Lukasz Urban. One of his colleagues said he was so dedicated to his work and his truck that he could be expected to defend the vehicle \"to the end.\" Ariel Zurawski, the owner of the trucking company and the victim's cousin, was asked by German authorities to identify Urban from photos. \"It was really clear that he was fighting for his life. His face was swollen and bloodied. Police informed me that he had suffered gunshot wounds. Despite being stabbed he was shot dead,\" Zurawski told Polish media. Frank said the method used in the rampage was reminiscent of July’s truck attack in Nice, France, and of the new “modius operandi” used my Islamic extremist groups. For those reasons, he said, we are \"naturally on high alert and are investigating in all directions.\" Six out of the 12 people killed have been identified and are all Germans, but he does not yet know whether the other six are as well, Muench added. Berlin police urged people to remain \"particularly vigilant\" and to report \"suspicious movement\" to a special hotline. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere -- Germany's top security official -- said Tuesday that authorities have \"no doubt\" that the attack was intentional. The truck struck a popular Christmas market packed with holiday shoppers outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial late Monday as tourists and locals were enjoying a traditional pre-Christmas evening out near Berlin’s Zoo station. \"All police measures concerning the suspected terror attack at Breitscheidplatz are being taken with great speed and the necessary care,\" Berlin police said on Twitter. The crash came less than a month after the U.S. State Department called for caution in markets and other public places across Europe, saying extremist groups including Islamic State and Al Qaeda were focusing \"on the upcoming holiday season and associated events.\" The Islamic State and Al Qaeda have both called on followers to use trucks in particular to attack crowds. On July 14, a truck plowed into Bastille Day revelers in the southern French city of Nice, killing 86 people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, which was carried out by a Tunisian living in France. No group had claimed responsibility for the Berlin attack as of early Tuesday. The revelations about the attacker's identity are likely to heap more pressure onto German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose decision to accept waves of migrants from Africa and the Middle East has stoked controversy and unsettled Germany and Europe. In Tuesday press conference, Merkel said she is “shocked, shaken and deeply saddened” by the attack. She had told reporters that it would be “particularly sickening” if it’s confirmed the attack was an asylum-seeker who sought refuge in Germany. Zurawski said he last spoke with the driver around noon, and the driver told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload Tuesday morning. \"They must have done something to my driver,\" he told TVN24. For several hours, the truck was started and stopped as if the driver was learning how to use the vehicle and finally pulled away at around 7:14 p.m. local time. By about 8:14 p.m., the truck had plowed into a group of people as it headed the wrong way on a street and then onto a sidewalk. Federal prosecutors, who handle terrorism cases, took over the investigation, according to German Justice Minister Heiko Maas. In Washington, White House National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said the United States was in contact with German officials and ready to help in the investigation and response. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump blamed Islamist terrorists, though it was unclear what that assessment was based on. He said Islamic extremists must be \"eradicated from the face of the earth\" and pledged to carry out that mission with all \"freedom-loving partners.\" Germany has not experienced any mass-casualty attacks by Islamic extremists, but has been increasingly wary since two attacks by asylum-seekers in the summer that were claimed by ISIS. Five people were wounded in an ax rampage on a train near Wuerzburg and 15 in a bombing outside a bar in Ansbach, both in the southern state of Bavaria. Both attackers were killed. Those attacks, and two others unrelated to Islamic extremism in the same weeklong period, helped stoke tensions in Germany over the arrival last year of 890,000 migrants.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(test_dataset['prompt'][1], tokenize = False, add_generation_prompt = True)\n","\n","from vllm import SamplingParams\n","sampling_params = SamplingParams(\n","    temperature = 0.8,\n","    top_p = 0.95,\n","    max_tokens = 1024,\n",")\n","output = model.fast_generate(\n","    text,\n","    sampling_params = sampling_params,\n","    lora_request = model.load_lora(\"grpo_saved_lora\"),\n",")[0].outputs[0].text\n","\n","output"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":104},"id":"1U0i8SkTK4WA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743759584958,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1914,"user":{"displayName":"Jahnavi Murali","userId":"10301287346042700169"}},"outputId":"d95a78a7-95d8-4c57-ab11-e3e86a0e0db3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Processed prompts: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:01<00:00,  1.90s/it, est. speed input: 1048.23 toks/s, output: 66.30 toks/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["' A truck attack at a Berlin Christmas market killed 12 people and injured over 50, with the Islamic State claiming responsibility.

Lawrence O’Donnell explains.\n","### Center Article\n","Trump official revises Statue of Liberty poem to defend migrant rule change 14 August 2019 A top US immigration official has revised a quote inscribed on the Statue of Liberty in defence of a new policy that denies food aid to legal migrants. The head of Citizenship and Immigration Services tweaked the passage: \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free\". The official added the words \"who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge\". He later said the poem had referred to \"people coming from Europe\". Ken Cuccinelli, the Trump administration's acting head of Citizenship and Immigration Services, announced on Monday a new \"public charge\" requirement that limits legal migrants from seeking certain public benefits such as public housing or food aid, or are considered likely to do so in the future. The new regulation, known as a \"public charge rule\", was published in the Federal Register on Monday and will take effect on 15 October. The rule change is intended to reinforce \"ideals of self-sufficiency\", officials said. Critics argue that it will prevent low-income US residents from seeking help. What did the official say? On Tuesday, Mr Cuccinelli was asked by NPR whether the 1883 poem titled The New Colossus at the Statue of Liberty still applied. \"Would you also agree that Emma Lazarus's words etched on the Statue of Liberty, 'Give me your tired, give me your poor,' are also a part of the American ethos?\" asked NPR's Rachel Martin. \"They certainly are,\" Mr Cuccinelli responded. \"Give me your tired and your poor - who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge.\" \"That plaque was put on the Statue of Liberty at almost the same time as the first public charge [law] was passed - very interesting timing,\" he added. The actual passage reads in part: \"Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\" In the interview, he added that immigrants are welcome \"who can stand on their own two feet, be self-sufficient, pull themselves up by their bootstraps, again, as in the American tradition\". After the host asked if the policy \"appears to change the definition of the American dream,\" he said: \"We invite people to come here and join us as a privilege. \"No one has a right to become an American who isn't born here as an American.\" Top immigration official says public charge rule will not target \"any particular group\" Mr Cuccinelli was pressed later on CNN about his comments, and pushed back on claims he was trying to re-write the poem. He insisted he was answering a question and accused people on the left of \"twisting\" his comments. Then asked by anchor Erin Burnett about what America stands for, he said: \"Of course that poem was referring back to people coming from Europe - where they had class-based societies where people were considering wretched if they weren't in the right class.\" The two then discussed their own immigrant ancestry, with Ms Burnett pointing out his rule would have \"excluded\" her family. \"I'm here because they were allowed in, and I'm an anchor on CNN,\" she said. Beto O'Rouke, a Democratic presidential hopeful from Texas, shared a clip from the interview and said the comments show his Trump administration \"think the Statue of Liberty only applies to white people\".

To view this content choose Accept and continue Who will be affected by the new rule? Immigrants who are already permanent residents in the US are unlikely to be affected by the rule change. It also does not apply to refugees and asylum applicants. But applicants for visa extensions, green cards or US citizenship will be subject to the change. Those who do not meet income standards or who are deemed likely to rely on benefits such as Medicaid (government-run healthcare) or housing vouchers in future may be blocked from entering the country. Those already in the US could also have their applications rejected. An estimated 22 million legal residents in the US are without citizenship, and many of these are likely to be affected. President Trump has made immigration a central theme of his administration. This latest move is part of his government's efforts to curb legal immigration. What has reaction been? The Democratic led House Homeland Security Committee condemned Mr Cuccinelli's revision in a tweet, calling the words \"vile and un-American\". \"It's clear the Trump Administration just wants to keep certain people out,\" the committee wrote, calling Mr Cuccinelli \"a xenophobic, anti-immigrant fringe figure who has no business being in government\". Others pointed to his background as the attorney general of Virginia, in which he led a conservative campaign against immigration and homosexuality. Asked about Mr Cuccinelli's remarks on Tuesday, President Trump did not directly respond to the Statue of Liberty quote, but said: \"I don't think it's fair to have the American taxpayer pay for people to come into the United States.\" \"I'm tired of seeing our taxpayer paying for people to come into the country and immediately go onto welfare and various other things.\n","### Right Article\n","Acting Director of Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli announced a change in the “public charge” rule Monday that will deny green cards for immigrants on Medicaid, food stamps, housing vouchers, and other public welfare. It of course elicited liberally charged questions from reporters. The “public charge” rule, enacted in 1882, requires green card applicants to prove they will not be a burden to the United States. The new changes, detailed in an 800-page document going into effect mid-October, will determine “the totality of the circumstances when making a public charge inadmissibility determination.” “Through the public charge rule, President Trump’s administration is re-enforcing the ideal of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility, ensuring that immigrants are able to support themselves and become successful in America,” Cuccinelli said in the press conference. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) arrests of several hundred illegal aliens in Mississippi last week incited yet another cycle of media outrage. Several White House reporters asked Cuccinelli about it. One quoted the poetic sentiment engraved on the Statue of Liberty, “Give me your tired, your poor…” Is this sentiment, he asked, still operative in the United States, or should it be removed from our statue? The reporter was referring to the poem “The New Colossus,” written by Emma Lazarus in 1883. At the end of the poem Lady Liberty cries out, “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!” This image of a destitute newcomer may seem in conflict with Cuccinelli’s self-sufficient immigrant. Is there a discrepancy in America’s immigration ethos? Are Lady Liberty’s words a reachable reality or a utopia? The answer typically depends on which side of the aisle you stand. The first ideal says it is the government’s humanitarian duty to welcome all poor seeking refuge in the United States. All who come to our borders deserve to be wrapped with taxpayer-funded welfare blankets, no matter how bankrupt our systems are. These ideals are espoused by the left. The second ideal is rooted in right-wing ideals of small government. It is not the government’s job to provide housing vouchers and Medicaid for everyone. The government’s first priority is to American citizens, and immigration policies and border controls are for our protection. We welcome immigrants here seeking the freedom that requires them to govern and provide for themselves. One reporter asked in the press conference, “Why shouldn’t the Latino community feel targeted by this?” “This is 140-year-old legal structure,” Cuccinelli said. “We’re dealing with the most recent iteration of it, but this is not new… There’s no reason for any particular group to feel like this is targeting them.” America cannot save the world from all suffering. Americans cannot afford to support welfare for any person in the world who gets here and then demands it. That does not change the spirit of our immigration laws that welcomes those made poor and needy by totalitarian governments that take wealth from some and redistribute it to others in currently politically favored groups. “We have a long history of being one of the most welcoming nations in the world on a lot of bases, whether you be an asylee, whether you be coming here to join your family, or immigrating yourself,” Cuccinelli said. “I do not think by any means, we’re ready to take anything off the Statue of Liberty.”\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(test_dataset['prompt'][0], tokenize = False, add_generation_prompt = True)\n","\n","from vllm import SamplingParams\n","sampling_params = SamplingParams(\n","    temperature = 0.8,\n","    top_p = 0.95,\n","    max_tokens = 1024,\n",")\n","output = model.fast_generate(\n","    text,\n","    sampling_params = sampling_params,\n","    lora_request = model.load_lora(\"grpo_saved_lora\"),\n",")[0].outputs[0].text\n","\n","output"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":139},"id":"bTXV6p9pLIRd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743759651102,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2936,"user":{"displayName":"Jahnavi Murali","userId":"10301287346042700169"}},"outputId":"fb7d89b5-0af9-41f0-836d-4239b29d66a2"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Processed prompts: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:02<00:00,  2.91s/it, est. speed input: 807.06 toks/s, output: 68.37 toks/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["' The Acting Director of Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ken Cuccinelli, has revised the Emma Lazarus poem on the Statue of Liberty to reflect a more self-sufficient immigration ethos, as part of the Trump administration\\'s new \"public charge\" rule.
