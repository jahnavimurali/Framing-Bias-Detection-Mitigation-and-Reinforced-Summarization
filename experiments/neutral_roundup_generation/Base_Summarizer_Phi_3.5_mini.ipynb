            "DOJ Rejects McCabe's Appeal to Avoid Charges\n",
            "### Left Article\n",
            "WASHINGTON — The Justice Department rejected a last-ditch appeal from defense lawyers for the former F.B.I. deputy director Andrew G. McCabe, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday, as prosecutors have appeared close to charging him in a criminal case.\n",
            "Lawyers for Mr. McCabe, who is being investigated over whether he lied to internal investigators about dealings with the news media, had argued that prosecutors lacked evidence to charge him. The lawyers detailed their position to top officials including Jeffrey A. Rosen, the deputy attorney general, who ultimately rejected their view. His deputy, Edward O’Callaghan, who was also present during the discussion, notified Mr. McCabe’s lawyers of the decision, one of the people said.\n",
            "The case is politically fraught for the Justice Department because of President Trump’s repeated attacks on Mr. McCabe, who was the acting director of the F.B.I. when investigators opened the inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice. Charging Mr. McCabe would undoubtedly please Mr. Trump, but passing on charges could provoke his public displeasure.\n",
            "The rejection of Mr. McCabe’s appeal would typically foreshadow an impending indictment, but that has apparently not yet happened. The grand jury hearing the case was recalled this week after going months without meeting but left without revealing any public signs of an indictment, The Washington Post reported. Grand jury proceedings are secret.\n",
            "It is also not clear when Mr. Rosen decided to reject the defense lawyers’ appeal.\n",
            "Mr. McCabe’s lawyers have vigorously denied that he intentionally lied and believe prosecutors singled him out. False statements made during internal inquiries at federal law enforcement agencies are typically punished administratively, not by criminal prosecution.\n",
            "The case centers on Mr. McCabe’s interactions with investigators for the Justice Department inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz. He faulted Mr. McCabe last year for misleading investigators when asked about the disclosure of information in 2016 to a Wall Street Journal reporter about an F.B.I. investigation into the Clinton Foundation. The inspector general referred Mr. McCabe’s case to prosecutors.\n",
            "Hints of the case’s weakness have since emerged. The investigation was referred about 18 months ago, which is an unusually long stretch for an inquiry with a limited set of facts and witnesses. It dragged on for so long that the first grand jury examining the evidence expired before apparently being called back this week.\n",
            "One prosecutor assigned to the case recently left, an unusual step so close to an indictment. Another departed for a private law firm and has expressed reservations about the merits of the case.\n",
            "And one key witness testified that Mr. McCabe had no motive to lie because he was authorized as the F.B.I.’s deputy director to speak to the media, so he would not have had to hide any discussions with reporters. Another important witness testified he could not immediately remember how the leak unfolded. Both would have been crucial to any prosecution.\n",
            "If a grand jury declined to indict — an embarrassment for prosecutors — they could ask for a different grand jury to present evidence and try to secure an indictment. Federal grand juries are made up of about 16 to 23 people, and at least 12 must concur with prosecutors to issue an indictment, according to Justice Department guidelines. A grand jury needs only to determine probable cause to indict, a lower standard than establishing guilt at a criminal trial.\n",
            "Prosecutors could also charge Mr. McCabe with lying in a criminal complaint and would then have 30 days to seek an indictment.\n",
            "The defense lawyers met multiple times with the prosecutors on the case to try to get them to drop charges, then appealed both to the United States attorney for the District of Columbia, Jessie K. Liu, and to Mr. Rosen. The prosecutors and Ms. Liu have all recommended charges, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Ms. Liu, a Trump appointee, had made a bid for the No. 3 job at the Justice Department but withdrew after senators objected to her nomination.\n",
            "The Justice Department could also be taking into account the case that prosecutors lost against Gregory B. Craig, one of Washington’s most prominent Democratic lawyers. He was acquitted this month of a felony charge of lying to federal authorities about work he did years ago for the Ukrainian government.\n",
            "Prosecutors from the same United States attorney’s office are handling the McCabe investigation.\n",
            "Mr. McCabe has been a consistent foil for Mr. Trump, who repeatedly attacked his wife, Jill, over her failed 2015 campaign for the Virginia Senate, which received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from a political committee run by a longtime ally of the Clintons.\n",
            "Mr. Trump seized on her campaign as proof that Mr. McCabe wanted to take him down while protecting Hillary Clinton, whom the F.B.I. had investigated for her use of a private email server. But ethics officials cleared Mr. McCabe of any conflict, and he did not take oversight of the Clinton case until after his wife lost her race.\n",
            "### Center Article\n",
            "WASHINGTON – Federal prosecutors recommended seeking criminal charges against Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI and a frequent target of criticism by President Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the decision Thursday.\n",
            "McCabe was fired from the FBI just before his retirement in March 2018 after the Justice Department's internal watchdog concluded that he improperly authorized a leak about a federal investigation into the Clinton Foundation in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. Investigators concluded that he displayed a lack of candor when asked about the leak.\n",
            "The U.S. attorney in Washington, Jessie Liu, recommended moving forward with unspecified charges against McCabe, according to people familiar with the situation who were not authorized to comment publicly. McCabe's lawyers appealed that decision to Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who rejected their request, one of the people said. McCabe's lawyers were informed of that decision Thursday.\n",
            "The decision clears the way for prosecutors to ask a grand jury to indict McCabe, though it was unclear Thursday whether that would happen. Whether McCabe is indicted will be up to a federal grand jury in Washington.\n",
            "The U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington declined to comment.\n",
            "The recommendation that McCabe be charged is the latest fallout from the FBI's handling of investigations around the 2016 presidential election, when agents investigated both of the major-party candidates. Those investigations – into Russian meddling to help Trump win the presidency and Democrat Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server – inserted the FBI into the center of fraught political controversies.\n",
            "Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe after a Justice Department Inspector General’s report found he misstated his involvement in a leak to The Wall Street Journal days before the election about an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation. He was ousted days before he could begin collecting retirement benefits.\n",
            "McCabe, who became acting FBI director after Trump fired James Comey in May 2017, has been the target of the president's attacks. Trump accused law enforcement officials of partisan investigations of him, his campaign and his administration. Inquiries led to charges against a half-dozen of Trump's aides and advisers.\n",
            "Trump applauded the decision to fire McCabe in March 2018, calling it \"a great day for democracy.” Trump called McCabe a \"major sleazebag\" and argued that his conduct was akin to treason for favoring Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival in 2016.\n",
            "The election-year investigations roiled the top ranks of the FBI. Internal investigators faulted McCabe and Comey for violating Justice Department rules in the final months of the campaign. Lower-level staffers were fired or reassigned.\n",
            "The Justice Department announced Aug. 29 that Comey violated bureau policies for keeping private memos about his conversations with Trump, then having a friend describe the contents of one memo to The New York Times for a story. The department didn't charge Comey criminally.\n",
            "McCabe's firing came after the inspector general investigated the information behind a Wall Street Journal story about the Clinton Foundation to determine whether it was an unauthorized leak and if so, who was the source. The story appeared online Oct. 30, 2016, and in print Oct. 31, which was a week after another story reported that McCabe terminated the foundation probe under pressure from the Justice Department.\n",
            "Investigators determined that McCabe, to promote his impartiality, authorized associates to disclose a call Aug. 12 between McCabe and the principal associate deputy attorney general to The Wall Street Journal. The call effectively confirmed the existence of the Clinton Foundation investigation, which Comey refused to do.\n",
            "The inspector general found McCabe “lacked candor” when he said he hadn't authorized the disclosure and didn't know who did while talking to Comey, when questioned under oath by FBI agents, then when questioned under oath by investigators for special counsel Robert Mueller.\n",
            "McCabe filed a lawsuit in August challenging his dismissal, alleging that Justice Department officials demoted him in January 2018 and fired him two months later to cater to Trump’s “unlawful whims.” McCabe's termination came after he had announced his intention to resign and days before his full retirement benefits would have set in.\n",
            "Trump's political accusations against McCabe stemmed from his wife running unsuccessfully for state Senate as a Democrat in Virginia. Trump seized on contributions Jill McCabe received from a political action committee tied with Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton ally.\n",
            "Trump said McCabe took “massive amounts of money” for his wife’s campaign.\n",
            "Internal FBI documents stated that McCabe didn't oversee the Clinton investigation while his wife was running for office and that he didn't have a conflict of interest. McCabe argued in television interviews that top congressional leaders were notified about the counterintelligence inquiry into Russian influence on Trump's campaign and nobody objected.\n",
            "The decision about McCabe comes amid several investigations of how the Justice Department and the FBI began inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Attorney General William Barr assigned one internal probe in May.\n",
            "Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s review launched in March 2018 focuses on an FBI wiretap of Carter Page, a former policy adviser to Trump's campaign. The inspector general looked into whether the FBI violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, when it sought court-ordered surveillance of Page in late 2016. Horowitz examined the FBI's relationship and communication with Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer who was hired by a research firm working for Clinton's campaign and compiled a \"dossier\" alleging links between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n",
            "Republicans complained that the FBI concealed its reliance on Steele's findings in the surveillance applications for Page. Copies of those applications released after USA TODAY and others sued showed investigators disclosed to judges that Steele sought information to \"discredit\" Trump and that investigators had broader suspicions about Page's ties to the Russian government.\n",
            "Mueller took over the Russia investigation in May 2017 after Trump fired Comey. Mueller's report, released in April, detailed a \"sweeping and systematic\" effort by the Russian government to intercede in the election to help Trump win but \"did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”\n",
            "### Right Article\n",
            "Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, a frequent target of President Donald Trump's wrath, faces the prospect of an indictment after his attorneys were unable to persuade senior Justice Department officials not to pursue charges that he lied to internal investigators.\n",
            "Two people familiar with the matter said Thursday that the deputy attorney general declined an appeal from McCabe's lawyers aimed at preventing a prosecution. The people weren't authorized to discuss the issue by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n",
            "Still, it wasn't immediately clear when or even whether the United States Attorney's Office in Washington, which has been leading the investigation , might announce charges.\n",
            "McCabe's attorneys have argued that he should not face charges on accusations that he lied to internal investigators about whether he had authorized a news media leak in the fall of 2016. McCabe has denied intentionally misleading anyone.\n",
            "An indictment of McCabe would refocus public attention on the chaotic months of 2016 when the FBI was entangled in presidential politics through investigations touching both main contenders — Democrat Hillary Clinton and Trump, her Republican opponent.\n",
            "And while prosecutors are likely to try to keep a narrow focus on whether McCabe lied to investigators on particular dates, McCabe's attorneys are expected to argue that the prosecution is part of a political vendetta driven by the president.\n",
            "They are likely to highlight the personal enmity between the two men , with Trump criticizing McCabe even before he took office and McCabe describing the president as a \"deliberate liar.\"\n",
            "McCabe's lawyers have said any false statements made to investigators were the product of a faulty memory, and that the interviews took place during a tumultuous time for the bureau as it investigated potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n",
            "McCabe became acting director of the FBI after Trump fired former Director James Comey on May 9, 2017.\n",
            "McCabe has said his 2018 firing — for what the Justice Department called \"lack of candor\" — was politically motivated.\n",
            "He sued the Justice Department in August, saying officials had used the inspector general's conclusions as a pretext to rid the FBI of leaders Trump perceived as biased against him.\n",
            "The investigation followed an October 2016 story in The Wall Street Journal that described internal debates roiling the FBI and the Justice Department weeks before the presidential election about how aggressively the Clinton Foundation should be investigated.\n",
            "The article recounted a particularly tense phone call between McCabe and a senior Justice Department official about the investigation.\n",
            "The inspector general's report said McCabe told internal investigators that he had not authorized anyone at the FBI to speak with the reporter, and he did not know who did.\n",
            "The report said McCabe ultimately corrected that account, and confirmed that he had encouraged the conversation with the reporter to counter a narrative that he thought was false — namely, that he had been trying to stymie investigations into Clinton and the foundation.\n",
            "McCabe has been a target of Trump's attacks since news emerged in the fall of 2016 that McCabe's wife had accepted campaign contributions from a political action committee associated with former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton ally, during an unsuccessful run for the state Senate.\n"

Here’s the catch: The Senate rules passed in the 1980s outlining how to do a trial say senators have to ask these questions in writing (to avoid grandstanding). The chief justice will read them out loud.\\n### Center Article\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told a group of Senate Republicans late Tuesday that he does not yet have the votes to stop Democrats from calling witnesses during the impeachment trial of President Trump, according to people familiar with the discussion.\\nBut even as McConnell made the concession, the dynamic remains fluid. Whether Democrats\\' push for witnesses succeeds or fails could come down to a group of moderate Republicans who have remained open, but uncommitted, to new witnesses since the start of the trial.\\nRepublicans privately are confident that they can overcome Democratic subpoenas for new witnesses. Democrats need at least four Republicans to cross party lines and support new witnesses in order to meet the threshold for bringing new witnesses and evidence into the trial.\\nPressure has been building on senators to hear from former National Security Adviser John Bolton, whom Democrats say has a first-hand account of Trump\\'s dealing with Ukraine at the heart of the impeachment case.\\nBolton, who has a forthcoming book detailing his knowledge of the Ukraine pressure campaign, has said he is willing to share his side of the story with senators.\\nYet Trump\\'s defense team has fought back, saying Bolton has nothing of value to offer senators, since they argue even if Bolton\\'s account is true, it would not clear the bar of constituting an impeachable offense.\\nEarlier Tuesday, President Trump\\'s defense team completed its arguments against his removal from office in the Senate impeachment trial.\\n\"I think we\\'ve made our case,\" White House counsel Pat Cipollone said. \"All you need in this case is the Constitution and your common sense.\"\\nHe said the two articles of impeachment passed last month by the House of Representatives — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress — \"fall far short of any constitutional standard and they are dangerous,\" a word he repeated several times in final remarks.\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said that starting Wednesday at 1 p.m. ET, senators will have a chance to submit written questions to the House impeachment managers and Trump\\'s defense lawyers through U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts, with each party alternating. They will have a total of 16 hours over two days for questions. After the questions wrap up, senators will then take up whether to call witnesses.\\nTuesday\\'s proceedings concluded against the backdrop of a New York Times report this week that cited the unpublished manuscript of a book being written by former national security adviser John Bolton about, among other things, his time in the Trump White House. Bolton writes, according to the newspaper, that Trump told him that he was withholding military aid to Ukraine until the government there began an investigation into political rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden\\'s and his son Hunter\\'s activities. That allegation is at the heart of Trump\\'s impeachment.\\nBut, in an apparent reference to the manuscript, Trump attorney Jay Sekulow told senators Tuesday that impeachment \"is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts.\" Most of the president\\'s lawyers have steered clear of the Bolton report, except for Alan Dershowitz, who argued Monday that even if the former national security adviser\\'s allegations were true, they weren\\'t sufficient to remove a president from office.\\nStill, the news report prompted Democrats to demand that Bolton be called as a witness in the Senate trial. Democrats need to persuade at least four Republicans to defect from their party\\'s leadership in order to support a subpoena of Bolton, a threshold that Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said on Monday appeared \"increasingly likely.\"\\nLoading...\\nSome Republicans have floated the idea of a deal on witnesses: one that would include calling Hunter Biden to testify. But before the final day of Trump\\'s defense began, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., dismissed that idea.\\n\"Hunter Biden has nothing to do with the facts of this trial,\" he said at a news conference Tuesday morning.\\nSchumer insisted that senators should hear from the same four witnesses whom he has been pushing for since the start of the trial — Bolton; acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney; Robert Blair, a White House official; and Michael Duffey, an official at the Office of Management and Budget.\\n\"We\\'re not bargaining with them — four witnesses and four sets of documents,\" Schumer said.\\nHe also dismissed a proposal floated by GOP Sens. James Lankford and Lindsey Graham to allow senators to read Bolton\\'s manuscript in the secure room in the Capitol, a room known as the \"SCIF.\" Schumer called this idea \"absurd.\"\\n\"It\\'s a book,\" he said. \"There\\'s no need for it to be read in the SCIF unless you want to hide something.\"\\nTrump\\'s lawyers, who began their arguments Saturday, had 24 hours over three days to make their case — the same time given to the Democratic House impeachment managers who presented their arguments against the president last week.\\nThe House impeachment articles accuse Trump of abuse of power for asking Ukraine to announce investigations into his political rivals, allegedly using $391 million in vital security assistance to pressure the country into launching the probes. The House articles also charge obstruction of Congress for the White House\\'s refusal to cooperate with impeachment investigators.\\nBut on Monday, Trump\\'s defense team offered vastly different version of events, arguing that the president\\'s freezing of military aid was done out of a legitimate concern over corruption in Ukraine, pointing out that the congressionally approved funding was eventually released.\\nEric Herschmann, another Trump defense lawyer, maintained that the holdup in military aid was not as consequential as Democrats have portrayed it to be.\\n\"It is absurd on its face. Not one American life was in jeopardy or lost by the short delay, and they know it,\" Herschmann said.\\nKen Starr, who is defending Trump and who led the investigation into President Bill Clinton that triggered Clinton\\'s impeachment, made the case that Trump\\'s impeachment, the third in American history, shows that \"we are living in what aptly can be described as the age of impeachment,\" adding the process is \"filled with acrimony and divides the country like nothing else.\"\\nTrump defense lawyer Pam Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida, also used Monday to attack the Biden family, playing a television interview with Hunter Biden answering questions about his time as a board member of the energy company Burisma when his father was vice president.\\nNeither Joe Biden nor his son has been accused of any wrongdoing connected to Ukraine and Burisma. Yet Bondi cited news outlets that have covered the Bidens and the energy company before saying: \"They all thought there was cause to raise the issue about the Bidens and Burisma.\"\\nAdded Bondi: \"The House managers might say, without evidence, that everything we just said has been debunked, that the evidence points entirely and unequivocally in the other direction. That is a distraction.\"\\nAndrew Bates, a spokesman for Joe Biden, characterized Bondi\\'s presentation as a \"conspiracy theory\" that has been \"conclusively refuted.\"\\n### Right Article\\nDonald Trump’s lawyers will wrap up their arguments on Tuesday in the U.S. Senate impeachment trial of the Republican president after attacking Democrat Joe Biden but shrugging off disclosures from a former top White House adviser.\\nIn about seven hours of arguments before the Senate on Monday, Trump’s lawyers largely ignored revelations in an unpublished manuscript by John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser, that go to the heart of impeachment charges against Trump.\\nTrump’s lawyers said they would continue their presentations on Tuesday. It was not clear when senators would begin submitting their questions to U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts, the next step in the Senate impeachment trial.\\nLawyer Pat Cipollone concluded Monday’s session with Republicans’ argument that Democrats were using impeachment as a way to overturn the results of the 2016 election as the next presidential vote approaches.\\n“An election is only months away and for the first time in history they are asking you to remove a president from the ballot,” he said.\\nBolton wrote that Trump told him he wanted to freeze $391 million in security aid to Ukraine until Kiev helped with investigations into Democrats including Democratic political rival Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden, the New York Times reported.\\nThe Bolton disclosures prompted new calls by Democrats for Bolton and other witnesses to testify. Trump is accused of abusing the power of his office in seeking foreign interference in a U.S. election and of obstructing Congress.\\nSome moderate Republicans, including Senators Mitt Romney and Susan Collins, said the disclosures were likely to sway at least four Republicans to call Bolton to testify, which would give Democrats the votes necessary in the Republican-led Senate to summon him.\\nSenate Republicans have so far refused, however, to allow any witnesses or new evidence in the trial that will determine whether Trump is removed from office.\\nTrump denied telling Bolton he sought to use the Ukraine aid as leverage to get Kiev to investigate the Bidens.\\nThe Democratic-led House of Representatives impeached Trump last month on charges of abuse of power in his dealings with Ukraine and obstruction of Congress, setting up the trial in the Republican-led Senate. Trump is expected to be acquitted in the 100-seat Senate, where Republicans hold 53 seats.\\nAs Trump’s legal team on Monday resumed its presentation of opening arguments in the trial, Bolton’s name only surfaced in passing during the final presentation.\\nInstead, defense lawyers turned to Biden, one of Trump’s leading Democratic rivals as he seeks re-election in November, and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma while his father was U.S. vice president.\\nAttorney Pam Bondi defended Trump’s use of unsupported corruption allegations against the Bidens as the basis for his demand that Ukraine investigate them. That drew a rebuke from Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates, who dismissed Bondi’s allegations as having been widely discredited.\\nUkrainian officials have said they found no indication that Hunter Biden had broken any law.\\nThe Senate may resolve the issue of whether to call witnesses in a vote on Friday or Saturday.\\n(Reporting by David Morgan, Patricia Zengerle, Susan Cornwell, Richard Cowan, Karen Freifeld, Eric Beech, James Oliphant; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Peter Cooney)'},\n",

            "December 2017 Jobs Report\n",
            "### Left Article\n",
            "The U.S. economy added 148,000 jobs in December after a year of steady hiring, missing expectations for a larger last-minute surge, the government reported Friday. The unemployment rate stayed at 4.1 percent last month, the lowest point since 2000. Wages continued their slow climb, rising by 9 cents to $26.63. That’s a 2.5 percent increase since December 2016 (and still below pre-recession levels).\n",
            "President Trump's first year in the White House brought healthy growth and 2.1 million new jobs, a slight drop from 2.2 million positions created during Obama's last year in office, government estimates showed Friday.\n",
            "The average number of jobs employers added each month in 2017 was 173,000, compared to the previous year’s 187,000.\n",
            "One dark spot was retail, which lost 20,000 jobs in December, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. About 67,000 positions vanished from stores in 2017, a sharp reversal from the 203,000 jobs that were added in 2016.\n",
            "“That’s a notoriously volatile number around the holiday season, but it also reflects in part that increasing number of sales are coming from e-commerce and not brick and mortar stores,” said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide. “That’s part of a longer term decline in that sector.”\n",
            "Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said in a statement Friday that the December report reflected “steady growth.”\n",
            "“With President Trump signing tax reform into law, 2018 will continue last year’s successes and, we hope, bring needed increases in wages and labor force participation,” he said. “Job creation, wage growth, and retirement savings drive prosperity and financial security. Strong growth in all is necessary.”\n",
            "Manufacturing saw strong gains in December, adding 25,000 jobs. The industry generated 196,000 jobs last year, compared to a loss of 16,000 positions in 2016.\n",
            "Analysts had predicted between 200,000 and 250,000 new positions would be created in December.\n",
            "“It’s certainly disappointing, but we’re still topping off a strong year for job creation, said Mike Loewengart, vice of president of investment strategy at E*TRADE, a financial services company in New York.\n",
            "The BLS report still sends a promising message to job seekers: Employers will be increasingly desperate for your applications in 2018. And while wages stayed flat in 2017, the unemployment rate sank at a faster pace, which gives economists hope that raises are on the horizon.\n",
            "“There’s almost one job open for every unemployed person,” said Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America, a credit insurance firm.\n",
            "There are now six million vacancies in the United States and 6.6 million unemployed people, to be more precise.\n",
            "However, companies nationwide keep struggling to fill roles, citing tight labor markets, retiring baby boomers and failed drug tests. Factories, hospitals, contractors and eateries, among other employers, face this trouble.\n",
            "“Restaurants are finding it extremely challenging to find workers,” Sonia Riggs, president and chief executive of the Colorado Restaurant Association, said in an email. “Many have even eliminated drug testing because finding employees is so difficult.”\n",
            "Employers increasingly are turning to on-the-job training to find and retain employees — but that could be keeping wages down.\n",
            "“In manufacturing and metals, especially, employers have been saying to me, ‘I could grow faster if I could find somebody, anybody,' ” said North, the economist. “They’ll hire whoever they can find, pay them a low wage and train them up.”\n",
            "Roughly 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 each day, and not enough young workers are cycling in to replace them.\n",
            "One forecast from Goldman Sachs predicted the unemployment rate will dip to 3.5 percent by the end of next year, the lowest since 1969.\n",
            "\"Such a scenario would take the U.S. labor market into territory almost never seen outside of a major wartime mobilization,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote in November.\n",
            "Economists can’t agree on why wages haven’t lifted with the demand for workers. As paid training spreads and more workers master skills that boost their productivity, paychecks should grow too, as companies compete for workers, said Josh Wright, chief economist at iCIMS, a hiring software company.\n",
            "“We’ll see more turnover,” he said. “Employers will be poaching more workers, and if workers feel undervalued, thinking, ‘I should have gotten that raise,’ they’re going to make a move.”\n",
            "That could be especially true in health care, which drove much of the job growth in 2017 and doesn’t appear to be slowing down.\n",
            "Nurses, physician assistants, home health aides and physical therapists are among the country’s fastest-growing jobs as the population ages.\n",
            "While manufacturing has enjoyed a four-month growth streak, analysts expect the sector to remain a sliver of the economy, compared to service-based work.\n",
            "But the hiring blitz hasn’t touched every corner of the country. West Virginia, where mining jobs have faded in recent decades, still has one of the highest jobless rates in the country (5.3 percent), and Ohio, which was hit hard by the manufacturing downturn, continues to grapple with a higher-than-average share of unemployed people (4.8 percent).\n",
            "“We can’t just say everything is roses,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union.\n",
            "People in areas where opportunities have declined are showing less desire to pack up and leave. In 2017, only 11.2 percent of Americans relocated, the smallest share since the Census began tracking it in 1948. Of those who moved, fewer than a fifth said they left for an employment-related reason.\n",
            "### Center Article\n",
            "The labor market slowed in December as U.S. employers added 148,000 jobs in a sign that worker shortages may crimp hiring in 2018.\n",
            "The unemployment rate, which is calculated from a different survey, was unchanged at 4.1%, the Labor Department said Friday.\n",
            "Maximize your savings: Best high-yield savings accounts\n",
            "The report provides the first unvarnished glimpse of hiring in several months. Average job growth topped 200,000 in October and November but economists attributed much of the increase to a bounce-back after hurricanes in Texas and Florida kept workers at home and suppressed September payrolls. The unemployment rate, a 17-year low, has spawned a tight market that may continue to scale back employment growth.\n",
            "\"The challenge in 2018 will be how to continue to add jobs when there are fewer people looking for them,\" says James Marple, senior economist for TD Economics.\n",
            "Last month, average hourly wages rose 9 cents to $26.63, nudging the annual increase to 2.5% from 2.4%. Pay gains have been stuck at about 2.5% for well over a year. Economists have expected a bigger spike because of the low unemployment rate that’s making it tougher for employers to find workers.\n",
            "Businesses added 146,000 jobs. Federal, state and local governments added 2,000.\n",
            "Job gains for October and November were revised down by a total 9,000. October’s was revised to 211,000 from 244,000 and November’s was upgraded to 252,000 from 228,000.\n",
            "A broader unemployment measure that includes discouraged workers and part-timers who prefer full-time jobs, as well as the unemployed, ticked up to 8.1% from 8% but is down from 9.1% a year ago.\n",
            "At least part of December’s weak performance can be chalked up to 20,000 job losses in retail, which faces upheaval as Americans increasingly shop online. Yet even professional and business services added just 19,000 jobs, far below its typical pace. Healthcare and leisure and hospitality each added 29,000. Mid-December storms played a role in tempering employment, Goldman Sachs said in a research note.\n",
            "Construction, however, added a relatively robust 30,000 jobs as rebuilding accelerated in the hurricane zones in Texas and Florida. Manufacturing added 25,000 as U.S. factories continue to benefit from an improving global economy and a revival in oil drilling.\n",
            "The disappointing report probably won’t stop the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates as soon as March in an effort to head off eventual jump in inflation as low unemployment pushes wages higher, several economists said.\n",
            "“We do not think that today’s employment report will keep the Federal Reserve from (hiking rates again in March) given other strong recent economic data…and the pickup in wage gains,” says David Berson, Nationwide’s chief economist. The Fed tentatively plans three quarter-point rate hikes this year.\n",
            "For 2017, monthly job gains averaged 171,000, down from 187,000 in 2016 and 226,000 in 2015. Many economists expect average increases of about 160,000 this year as the low unemployment rate offers employers a smaller pool of available workers. Yet even that more moderate pace would be far more than enough to continue pushing down the jobless rate. And the smaller stock of job candidates should ignite faster wage gains as businesses compete more intensely for applicants.\n",
            "Other economists, however, point to a shadow supply of workers who aren’t counted in the official unemployment rate, such as discouraged Americans who stopped looking for jobs but may be lured back into an improving market. That group could keep hiring elevated and temper pay increases well into 2018.\n",
            "Other recent labor market indicators have been encouraging. Payroll processor ADP this week said businesses added 250,000 jobs in December. And surveys of the manufacturing and service sectors continue to show sharp pickups in activity.\n",
            "Many economists believe the economy grew at close to a 3% annual pace during the last three months of the year. That would mark the third straight quarter of advances at or above the sturdy 3% level.\n",
            "### Right Article\n",
            "Nearly 150,000 jobs were added last month while the unemployment rate remained steady from November, according to the Department of Labor’s December jobs report.\n",
            "Americans’ average hourly income rose by 9 cents to $26.63 in the last month of the year, securing a 2.5 percent increase in wages over 2017, The New York Times reports.\n",
            "At 148,000 jobs, the number came in lower than predicted. With six million open jobs in the U.S. and 6.6 million people currently unemployed, hiring should remain strong throughout 2018, however, according to The Washington Post.\n",
            "In total, 2017’s average monthly job growth was below the previous year, yet still at healthy levels, economists say.\n",
            "Throughout the year, employers found skilled labor harder to find and keep. Retiring baby boomer and drug abuse has resulted in many open positions, while competitive labor markets make hiring difficult, WaPo reports.\n",
            "Companies in the most competitive markets have begun increasing wages in order to attract the workers they need. Melton Truck Lines CEO Bob Peterson increased pay for 1,600 truck drivers in his company.\n",
            "“With unemployment this low, anyone worth their salt has got a job and probably a darn good one,” Peterson told TheNYT.\n"

            "TOKYO — President Trump kicked off an extensive swing through Asia with a campaign-style rally on Sunday with American troops in Japan, as he looked toward a lengthy trip likely to be dominated by talks on confronting the nuclear threat from North Korea.\n",
            "In a speech after Air Force One landed at Yokota Air Base in Tokyo on a crisp, sunny morning, Mr. Trump never mentioned Pyongyang by name. Sounding a militaristic tone, he sought to project toughness in the face of global challenges, saying the United States armed forces stood ready to defend itself and its allies and “fight to overpower” its adversaries.\n",
            "“No one — no dictator, no regime and no nation — should underestimate, ever, American resolve,” Mr. Trump said, having shed his suit jacket for a leather bomber jacket as he addressed hundreds of fatigues-clad women and men. “You are the greatest threat to tyrants and dictators who seek to prey on the innocent.”\n",
            "Breaking with tradition for American presidents on foreign soil, Mr. Trump used his speech to promote his domestic record with a distinct political edge, asserting that the economy and military were far better off since he became president.\n",
            "### Center Article\n",
            "President Donald Trump has landed in Japan, the first Asian country he is visiting during his 12-day tour of the region.\n",
            "He is meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who will host the US president for a meeting with families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea. Trump is also meeting with American and Japanese service members.\n",
            "Longstanding US allies in the Asia Pacific like Japan will likely be looking for signs of continued American support from Trump amid the ongoing North Korea crisis, especially since he pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.\n",

            "US President Donald Trump has landed in Japan, the first Asian country he is visiting during his 12-day tour of the region.\n",
            "Trump already golfed and dined with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who will host the US president for a meeting with families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea. Trump is also scheduled to meet with American and Japanese service members, and said shortly after landing that \"it's expected\" he'll meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the trip.\n",

            "Overall, Trump's Asia tour aims to \"underscore his commitment to longstanding United States alliances and partnerships, and reaffirm United States leadership in promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific region,\" the White House said.\n",

            "Longstanding US allies in the Asia Pacific like Japan will likely be looking for signs of continued American support from Trump, especially since the American president pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, which was largely seen as a statement about the US's long-term commitment to the region.\n",

            "US President Donald Trump puts on a military jacket as he meets the US troops at the US Yokota Air Base, on the outskirts of Tokyo, Sunday, Nov. 5, 2017. AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko\n",
            "The day before he departed for his trip, Trump called Japan a \"warrior nation\" and said China might have a \"big problem with Japan pretty soon\" over North Korea in an interview with Fox News Channel's \"The Ingraham Angle.\"\n",
            "\"Well, you know Japan is a warrior nation. And I tell China and I tell everyone else that, listen, you’re going to have yourself a big problem with Japan pretty soon if you allow this to continue with North Korea,\" Trump said during the interview.\n",
            "He said that \"of course\" Japan is worried about North Korea and that \"they should be worried. You know, they're very close to North Korea.\" But he also added that \"China has been helping us\" with the North Korea crisis.\n",
            "Japan has formally been a pacifist nation since the end of the World War II. Japan's constitution, which came into effect in 1947 after the war, includes an article (which the US pushed to be added) that renounces war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means by which to settle international disputes. But Abe has made efforts to \"remove pacifist constraints\" on the military.\n",
            "His ruling coalition recently won a more than two-thirds majority in snap elections. Abe is now set to be the longest-serving prime minister in postwar Japan, and is expected to use his new mandate to push for changes in the country's defense strategy, according to CNN.\n",
            "His defense agenda has, arguably, been helped forward by the ongoing North Korea crisis, even though about half of poll respondents in Japan disagree with revising the pacifist clause. It's possible that if the US appears to pull out of regional disputes in Asia, Abe might be inspired to move his defense agenda forward.\n",
            "'Indo-Pacific' versus 'Asia-Pacific'\n",
            "Japan's first lady Akie Abe, US first lady Melania Trump, US President Donald Trump, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pose for a photo before having a dinner at Ginza Ukai Tei restaurant, Sunday, Nov. 5, 2017, in Tokyo. Kim Kyung-Hoon/Pool Photo via AP\n",
            "Interestingly, Washington has long referred to the region the president is visiting as the \"Asia-Pacific,\" but the Trump administration has instead opted to call it the \"Indo-Pacific.\"\n",
            "The AP suggested it might be an attempt to create more distance between Trump and his predecessor Barack Obama and his \"Pivot to Asia\" strategy, but the switch could also suggest that the administration wants to highlight that the region is more than just China's backyard. In fact, recently Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke about expanding ties with India, who had seen some tensions with China earlier this year, and about partnering with allies like Australia and Japan, as the AP notes.\n",
            "However, it's notable that the moniker \"Indo-Pacific\" doesn't come with a unified economic plan. This is in contrast to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was supposed to lower tariffs for 12 countries around the Pacific Rim, including Japan and Mexico but excluding China. The trade agreement was negotiated under the Obama administration as an arm of its \"Pivot to Asia,\" before the Trump administration announced its withdrawal.\n",
            "### Right Article\n",
            "President Trump on Sunday discussed trade and North Korea problems over golf and dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, as a prologue to the most critical stretch of the president’s 12-day Asia trip that starts Monday with formal talks in Tokyo.\n",
            "“We are in the midst of discussions on many subjects, including North Korea and trade and other things,” Trump said before the dinner in Tokyo with first lady Melania Trump and Abe’s wife, Akie Abe. “But time is a little bit limited. Tomorrow’s a busy day.”\n",
            "To be sure, formal talks between Trump and Abe, who appear to have a solid diplomatic relationship, begin in Tokyo with tensions running high about North Korea. The two world leaders are expected to focus on how to present a united front to stop North Korea’s pursuit of a nuclear arsenal -- made clear recently by leader Kim Jong Un’s repeated nuclear and ballistic-missile tests.\n",
            "Trump will be looking for Japan to limit trade with neighboring North Korea, to squeeze the rogue nation economically, while Abe wants reassurances that the United States will stand by its treaty obligations to defend Japan if attacked.\n",
            "After visiting Japan, Trump then travels to South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.\n",
            "Sunday’s casual lunch, nine holes of golf at the Kasumigaseki Country Club and the dinner will give way Monday to formal talks, a press conference and a state dinner.\n",
            "Eager to forge a bond with Tokyo's crucial ally, Abe was one of the first world leaders to court President-elect Donald Trump. He was the first to call Trump after the election, and rushed to New York days later to meet the president-elect and present him with a pricey, gold Honma golf driver.\n",
            "The two men also met on the sidelines of an international summit in Italy this spring and Trump hosted Abe in Florida. White House officials said Trump has spoken with Abe by phone more than any world leader, aside from British Prime Minister Theresa May.\n",
            "That bond was clear on Sunday.\n",
            "\"The relationship is really extraordinary,” Trump also said Sunday before the dinner. “We like each other, and our countries like each other.\"\n",
            "When Trump hosted Abe in Palm Beach earlier this year, they played at one of Trump's Florida golf courses. For that outing, Trump brought along pro golfer Ernie Els, so this time Abe matched him by bringing along Japanese pro Hideki Matsuyama, who Trump described on the plane ride to Asia as \"probably the greatest player in the history of Japan.\"\n",
            "Before the game, Trump delivered a speech in which he hailed Japan as a \"crucial ally\" and warned adversaries not to test America's resolve.\n",
            "\"Japan is a treasured partner and crucial ally of the United States and today we thank them for welcoming us and for decades of wonderful friendship between our two nations,\" Trump told American and Japanese service members at Yokota Air Base on the outskirts of Tokyo, after arriving from Hawaii, his first stop on the trip.\n",
            "Though Trump did not mention North Korea by name during the speech, the specter of its weapons program will loom large throughout Trump's five-nation trip. The president warned of the consequences of crossing what he called the \"most fearsome fighting force in the history of our world.\"\n",
            "\"Together with our allies, America's warriors are prepared to defend our nation using the full range of our unmatched capabilities. No one — no dictator, no regime and no nation — should underestimate, ever, American resolve,\" he told the troops.\n",
            "And while there is worry in the region about Trump's unpredictable response to the threat posed by Kim, Trump made clear he did not intend to tone down his bellicose rhetoric -- including dubbing Kim \"Little Rocket Man\" -- even while in an Asian capital within reach of the North Korea dictator's missiles.\n",
            "\"There's been 25 years of total weakness, so we are taking a very much different approach,\" he said, speaking to reporters on Air Force One.\n",
            "Trump also will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of an upcoming summit in Vietnam.\n",
            "The easy rapport with Japan could be strained if Trump takes an aggressive approach on trade or the two men disagree on how best to approach the threat looming in Pyongyang. During his campaign, Trump suggested Japan should acquire its own nuclear weapons to defend itself, hinted the U.S. might not come to the nation's defense, and accused Japan of \"killing us\" on trade. He has dropped that antagonist language almost entirely since the election, but tensions remain.\n",
            "Scott Seaman, a director for Asia of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultant organization, noted: \"everything is fine with Trump until you tell him no. So far, Abe hasn't told him no.\"\n"

            "CRTV's Gavin McInnes was recently kicked off Twitter for reasons unknown, other than that he supposedly violated their guidelines. But, conservatives have long argued that even if these social media websites do not explicitly block an individual or organization from using their platform, that the company would in effect place a \"shadow ban\" on their accounts and prevent their followers from seeing their tweets. James O'Keefe's Project Veritas even recorded Twitter engineers discussing how they planned on preventing certain viewpoints from being aired on their platform.\n",

We’re trying to get the sh*tty people to not show up,\" one engineer said on a recorded video. \"It’s a product thing we’re working on right now.” As further evidence showed, \"sh*tty\" in this case would mean anybody who was tweeting about guns, God, or the flag or other right-leaning viewpoints.\n",
            "Not only does Twitter shadow ban prominent Republicans, they also consider any Trump supporter who tweets about \"God,\" \"guns,\" or \"the flag\" a Russian bot (as seen in our undercover expose.) https://t.co/lxo0JoN2GP pic.twitter.com/MAPhk8tsvr — James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) July 25, 2018\n",
            "While that video purports to show what happens behind the scenes at just Twitter, many on the right fear that this sort of shadowbanning occurs on all left-wing platforms that spring out of the liberal Silicon Valley. Just last night, Dennis Prager's \"Prager U\" showed statistics highlighting that despite having nearly 3 million followers on Facebook, their most recent 9 posts were seen by zero of their followers.\n",

            "Given the relatively new influence of social media in American society, it is not obvious what steps forward the government can, or should, take to prevent censorship in political discourse on privately owned websites. The president's tweets appear to indicate that he wants to address the issue but given that conservatives often argue against market interference the exact remedy to the solution remains unclear.\n"
