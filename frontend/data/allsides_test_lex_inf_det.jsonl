Its origins are rooted in the Civil War era, where it began as a way for Americans, both North and South, to pay respect to soldiers who lost their lives in the conflict. The day evolved over time, particularly after World War I, to include all military personnel who died in wars, not just the Civil War.However, the holiday's essence of remembrance and honoring the fallen has been somewhat overshadowed by commercialization and leisure activities, especially in recent years. Some veterans and military families believe that many Americans have forgotten the true purpose of Memorial Day due to the growing disconnect between military and civilian life.Veterans groups like the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America are making efforts to rekindle public understanding through campaigns like #GoSilent. There's an emphasis on the somber remembrance of those who've given their lives for their country, as opposed to the picnics and backyard barbecues that have become associated with the day.Congress has altered the date of the holiday to the last Monday in May to provide a three-day weekend, which some believe has contributed to diluting its original solemnity. It's worth noting that while Veterans Day and Memorial Day have distinct origins and purposes, the narrative for both remains centered around respect and gratitude for those who have served.In the discourse around Memorial Day, there's a call to remember the spirit of reconciliation, as exemplified by early ceremonies that included both Union and Confederate soldiers. The original intent of Memorial Day was to unify Americans in remembrance of the fallen, regardless of which side they fought for. Today's challenges to this unity reflect a wider societal struggle to maintain a sense of shared history and purpose.The articles emphasize the need for respect, remembrance, and a return to the holiday's roots, urging individuals to stop, reflect, and honor the sacrifice of those who have served their country. This includes a respectful engagement with veterans, recognizing their service without resorting to platitudes, but rather through meaningful gestures like a friendly conversation or physical presence."], "news": {"left": {"stance": "left", "stance_specific": "lean left", "newsSource": "CBS News", "newsTitle": "Memorial Day losing its meaning, vets groups and families lament", "newsLink": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/memorial-day-losing-its-meaning-vets-groups-and-families-lament/", "newBody": [[0, "ANNVILLE, Pa. -- Allison Jaslow heard it more than once as the long holiday weekend approached -- a cheerful \"Happy Memorial Day!\""], [1, "from oblivious well-wishers."]], "topicID": "5286", "opinionTag": null, "newsContent": ["ANNVILLE, Pa. --", "Allison Jaslow heard it more than once as the long holiday weekend approached -- a cheerful \"Happy Memorial Day!\" from oblivious well-wishers.", "The former Army captain and Iraq War veteran had a ready reply, telling them, matter-of-factly, that she considered it a work weekend.", "Jaslow will be at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday to take part in the annual wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.", "She'll then visit Section 60, the final resting place of many service members who died in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "\"You can see it in people's faces that they're a little horrified that they forget this is what the day's about,\" said Jaslow, 34, who wears a bracelet bearing the name of a fallen comrade. \"Culturally, we've kind of lost sight of what the day's supposed to mean.\"", "While millions of Americans celebrate the long Memorial Day weekend as the unofficial start of summer -- think beaches and backyard barbecues, mattress sales and sporting events -- some veterans and loved ones of fallen military members wish the holiday that honors more than 1 million people who died serving their country would command more respect.", "Or at least awareness.", "\"It's a fun holiday for people: 'Let's party.'
